# Part I - Introduction to JavaScript

__For most exercises you will need to have a basic html form structure, feel free to omit the CSS part as this is not the focus of the exercises!__

## Exercises

### Type Conversion Exercise:
- Begin by prompting the user to enter two values, one as a string and the other as a number.
- Use the `parseInt()` function and the `.toString()` method to convert the string to a number and the number to a string, respectively.
- Perform addition on the two numbers.
- Finally, display the result.

### Logical Operators Exercise:
- Start by prompting the user to enter their age.
- Use logical operators (&&) to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 65.
- Display appropriate messages based on whether the user is eligible for voting or retirement benefits.

### Conditional Operator Exercise:
- Prompt the user to enter a number.
- Use the conditional (ternary) operator ? : to check if the number is even or odd.
- Display the result accordingly.

### Typeof Operator Exercise:
- Prompt the user to enter different types of values (number, string, boolean).
- Use the typeof operator to determine the type of each value.
- Display the type of each entered value.

### String Concatenation and Template Literals Exercise:
- Prompt the user to enter their first name and last name separately.
- Use string concatenation (+ operator) or template literals to construct a personalized greeting message.
- Display the greeting message.

### Mathematical Operations Exercise:
- Prompt the user to enter the radius of a circle.
- Use the Math.PI constant and the Math.pow() function to calculate the area of the circle (area = Ï€ * r^2).
- Display the calculated area.

### Comparison Operators Exercise:
- Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
- Use comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, ===, !==) to compare the two numbers.
- Display the result of each comparison.

### Increment and Decrement Operators Exercise:
- Initialize a variable with an integer value.
- Use both the pre-increment (++i) and post-increment (i++) operators to increment the variable by 1.
- Display the value of the variable before and after each increment operation.

# Part II - Control Structures

  - Chapter 2 (Program Structure)

## Exercises

### Nested Control Structures Exercise:
- Write a program that prompts the user to enter their age and their country of residence.
- Use nested if-else statements to determine if the user is eligible to vote based on their age and country.
- You may need to incorporate additional conditions based on the user's country's voting laws.

### Looping and Conditionals Exercise:
- Develop a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Use a while loop to continuously prompt the user to guess the number until they guess it correctly.
- Provide feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

### Switch Case Exercise:
- Create a program that prompts the user to enter a month (as a number from 1 to 12).
- Use a switch statement to determine the number of days in that month and display the result.
- Ensure to account for leap years when calculating the number of days in February.

### Looping and Control Flow Exercise:
- Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Use a for loop to iterate over each number from 1 to the generated random number.
- Within the loop, determine if each number is prime and display the prime numbers found.

### Complex Conditional Exercise:
- Create a program that simulates a game of rock-paper-scissors.
- Prompt the user to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
- Generate a random choice for the computer.
- Use nested if-else statements to determine the winner based on the choices made by the user and the computer.

### Looping and Break Statements Exercise:
- Develop a program that simulates a simple ATM.
- Prompt the user to enter their PIN.
- Use a while loop to allow the user to enter their PIN up to three times.
- If the correct PIN is entered, display a success message and break out of the loop. Otherwise, display a failure message after three unsuccessful attempts.

### Advanced Looping Exercise:
- Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
- Use a loop to calculate each term of the sequence.
- Display the generated Fibonacci sequence.

### Advanced Control Flow Exercise:
- Create a program that simulates a simple grading system.
- Prompt the user to enter their score.
- Use a series of nested if-else statements to determine their grade based on the score.
- Consider incorporating letter grades (A, B, C, etc.) and their corresponding score ranges.
