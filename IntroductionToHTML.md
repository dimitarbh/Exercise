## Part 1: Basic Structure with HTML

### Reading
- To understand HTML structure, tags, elements, and attributes, please read pages 11-27, 39-59, and 427-450 from [this source](https://archive.org/details/htmlandcss/page/429/mode/2up).

### Exercise

Create a "Local Community Event Hub" website that showcases community events, workshops, and local news. The site will serve as a hub for residents and visitors to find interesting activities, learn about local businesses, and participate in community discussions.

### Task

Create the homepage of the Local Community Event Hub with the following elements:

- Use headings to introduce the site and sections (Upcoming Events, Local News, Featured Workshops, and more if desired).
- Add paragraphs to describe the community hub's purpose and detail the events. Feel free to be creative with the content or use Lorem Ipsum generated content.
- Create a navigation list linking to different sections of the site (Home, Events, News, Contact Us), and fill them in with the proper content.
- Include links to external resources, such as local government and sponsors (you can use our Varna sites for authenticity, remember down the line we will upgrade those pages, and they can be used for our GitHub projects).

## Part 2: Advanced HTML Features

- [HTML Forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms)
