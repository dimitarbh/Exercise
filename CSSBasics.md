## Part 3: Styling with CSS

### Reading
To understand CSS and how to style our website better, read the following pages 226-261 from [this source](https://archive.org/details/htmlandcss/page/429/mode/2up).

### Exercise

Apply CSS to enhance the visual appeal of the site:

- Define a color scheme and apply colors to backgrounds, text, and links. Include primary, secondary, and extra colors as outlined in the CSS file.
- Choose fonts that are readable and fit the community theme. Implement at least two fonts from Google Fonts that will fit the site.
- Implement a basic layout using standard CSS positioning and alignment, ensuring the content is well-organized and visually appealing. You can use the example with the journal form the handbook or create a design that appeals to you.

## Part 4: Flexbox and CSS Grid

### Reading
To learn about Flexbox and CSS Grid, please read the following:

- [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flexbox)
- [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout)

### Exercise

Refine the layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid:

#### Task 1: Flexbox

- Convert the main layout to use Flexbox, ensuring the navigation, main content, and sidebar (if any) are properly aligned and responsive.

#### Task 2: CSS Grid

- Recreate the layout with CSS Grid in a separate HTML file. Compare and practice both layout techniques, especially for the Events table and any grid-based sections.
